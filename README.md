This is first time me trying mobile programming
I decided to build a practical app for myself. in this application you are capable of adding your debit cards and
add your transactions to it but there are some features. user can categorize their expenses,
modify and delete them if needed? they can view their transactions with a custom range and add notes to them.
they can also see a report of how much they gain, spent and what categories had the most share and view their
balance too in they're selected time for the report. This project actually took much longer that I anticipated but
I thinks I turns out good.
